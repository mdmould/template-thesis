# thesis-template

Minimal but nicely styled. thesis template

You should edit `frontmatter/info.tex` and the other frontmatter pages in `frontmatter/`, which you can choose to make appear or not in `main.tex`.

Files in `style/` should not be edited.

Chapter and appendix templates are located in `chapters/` and you should add `.tex` files for each.

Add your figures in `figures/`, with a folder for each chapter if you like.

Add all your references to `main.bib`.

Compile the PDF with `compile.sh` and remove the excess build files with `clean.sh`, which will keep the final `main.pdf`.
